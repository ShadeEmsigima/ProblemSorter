                        "or, you have a list a problems right now." +

                "Anyway, it turns out I was 'engineered' to sort such things out, for I am a sorter of lists of type 'problem'." +
                        "Tell me your different problems, spaced with a comma, and I will work my numerical magic." +
                        "Hit enter to submit your list."

                "You know I'm not a person, so the usage of 'me' might seems strange for you to read." +
                "But know this; all software, hardware, or even fictional characters in forgotten books, have a human hart and mind create them." +
                "There is intent behind the apps you use, the keyboard you type or swipe with, and the feelings you have for characters in a story." +
                "The thing you 'submit' your answers to." +
                "They are not sent to any database, or saved on a device for another to see." +
                "So the only one you are sharing answers with, is yourself. I hope you are being honest.");

        System.out.println("You've made the first step into sorting the problems, getting them out of your head or heart, and expose them on paper!" +
                "Well, pixels I suppose." +
                "Now, there are a few things I could do for you." +
                "1) Would you like me to sort them out right away?" +
                "2) or shall I chop them up into smaller problems first?");

                "No good? I assure you I've ordered them from small to large." +
                "Alright alright, I yield! I sorted them based on the size of their datatype and value..." +
                "Don't worry about what that means, though." +
                "However, as much as this is a pun, there might be some accuracy in what I've accomplished." +
                "You see, one might say the length of your longest answer actually represents how much it weighs on your heart." +
                "Have another look inside that human heart of yours, perhaps you can chop the problem up even more.");

        //chop
        System.out.println("I will start with the longest problem first" +
                "This one seems to be a sentence, in which I detect at least one subject... maybe an adjective too?" +

                "");
        System.out.println("This one seems to be a single word. That's good, it means you have already chopped it up as small as you could yourself." +
                "To be fair, I cannot divide this one into smaller bits by myself, but that does not mean by FAR that that is a bad thing." +
                "Making them smaller is the first step at least in my personal strategies, at least for me.");

        //end
        System.out.println("Before you end this program, I want to challenge you with one final (nerdy) riddle." +
                "What's the commonality between a 'throws clause' and knowing oneself?" +
                "or that between try/catch blocks and knowing oneself?" +
                "It all has to do with knowing you might RUN into problems." +
                "Either one that stops you while trying to compile life-events and emotions, or run-time ones that might trip you!" +
                "Know what might cause you to throw an error, trip you up, or shut you down." +
                "And know what to do in case such a thing might happen." +
                "Is it much like an error, in the way of you--the program in question--not being able to fix the error yourself?" +
                "find another machine, another person, who can help you when your program crashes." +
                "Good luck!");
